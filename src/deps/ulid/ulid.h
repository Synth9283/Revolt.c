/* Initialize a new ULID generator instance.
 *
 * The ULID_RELAXED flag allows ULIDs generated within the same
 * millisecond to be non-monotonic, e.g. the random section is generated
 * fresh each time.
 *
 * The ULID_PARANOID flag causes the generator to clear the highest bit
 * of the random field, which guarantees that overflow cannot occur.
 * Normally the chance of overflow is non-zero, but negligible. This
 * makes it zero. It doesn't make sense to use this flag in conjunction
 * with ULID_RELAX.
 *
 * The ULID_SECURE flag doesn't fall back on userspace initialization if
 * system entropy could not be gathered. You _must_ check the return
 * value if you use this flag, since it now indicates a hard error.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the generator was successfully initialized from secure
 * system entropy. Returns 1 if this failed and instead derived entropy
 * in userspace (or is uninitialized in the case of ULID_SECURE).
